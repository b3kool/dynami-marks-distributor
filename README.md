# Quiz-to-Test Marks Distribution Web App

This project is a web-based tool designed to simplify the process of distributing quiz marks across multiple tests. It allows users to upload a CSV file with quiz scores and then automatically distributes the scores across a specified number of tests, making grading easier for educators. The app is built using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Aeternity UI** components for a user-friendly and responsive experience.

## Project Overview

This application was created to help professors or educators distribute quiz marks into a series of tests. Often, quizzes are fewer in number than the total tests a professor wishes to include in the grading system. By allowing the user to input the number of quizzes and tests, this app automates the process of converting quiz marks into test scores. 

Key features of the app include:
- CSV file upload for batch processing of students' scores.
- Flexible input for the number of quizzes and tests.
- A drag-and-drop interface to make the experience smooth and user-friendly.
- Simple download of the processed results as a CSV file.

## Features

- **CSV File Upload**: Users can upload a CSV file containing the quiz scores and student registration numbers.
- **Variable Input for Quizzes and Tests**: After uploading the CSV, the user can specify how many quizzes they have and how many tests they want to distribute the scores into.
- **Automated Marks Distribution**: The app automatically distributes the total marks from quizzes into the specified number of tests.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A drag-and-drop interface built with Tailwind CSS and Aeternity UI components ensures a smooth user experience.
- **CSV Download**: After processing, users can download the updated data with test scores.

## Why I Built This

I created this app to help my professor convert a set number of quizzes into a larger set of tests to simplify the process of calculating marks distribution. While tools like Excel can accomplish this, not everyone is skilled in spreadsheet manipulation. This app simplifies the task by providing an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.

## How It Works

1. **Upload CSV File**: The user starts by uploading a CSV file containing the student registration numbers and quiz marks.
2. **Specify Quizzes and Tests**: After uploading, a pop-up allows the user to specify the number of quizzes and the number of tests they want the marks distributed across.
3. **Automated Processing**: The app calculates the total quiz marks and evenly distributes them across the specified tests, adding any remainder marks to the last test.
4. **Download Results**: The processed results, with test scores, are available for download as a CSV file.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Running the Project Locally

Once the project is installed, you can access it locally by running the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy this app to GitHub Pages:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

3. Set the **GitHub Pages** source to the `gh-pages` branch in your repository's settings.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application. (to be implemented soon)
- **Aeternity UI**: To enhance the UI with pre-built components. (to be implemented soon)
- **PapaParse**: For parsing and processing CSV files.

## Future Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Adding better error handling for invalid CSV formats or missing data.
- **More Test Distribution Options**: Allowing users to customize how marks are distributed across tests (e.g., weighted distributions).
- **Graphical Feedback**: Adding visual feedback like charts for marks distribution.
